# 100-Doors
simple java program about opening doors.
All doors are closed at the beginning.
Each iteration opens doors that are multiples of that number 
eg. iteration #2 opens doors 2,4,6 ... etc and closes doors that were previously open.
The objective is to reach the 100th iteration and see which doors are opened.

The solution happens to be: 
Doors 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.
Which happen to be  integer squares between 1 and 100.
